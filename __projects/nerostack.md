# HSC SDD Major Project

For this project, I have decided to develop a simple multiplayer sharemarket game, targeted at Business Studies / Economics Students. Players are initially given $US 50,000 to invest in any company listed on the ASX (Australian Securities Exchange), NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) and other markets available in the yahoo finance API. 

The aim of the game will be for players to grow the value of their portfolio over a 3 month period, competing against players across the platform. The game will use live prices and a brokerage fee will be charged for each trade executed by players. It gives players a chance to trade without using real money.

This stock exchange game will be a great way for students to:
- Develop their knowledge of the sharemarket.
- Experience what it is like to buy and sell shares.
- Learn alongside and compete against friends.

# Game Rules
1. The game will run for 3 months (quarterly periods) over the course of a year. Leaderboards will be reset after each quarterly period is over. 
2. When a user creates a new virtual portfolio, he or she will be given $50, 000.
A small brokerage fee of $10 is charged on each trade executed by the players. This fee will be taken out of the playerâ€™s portfolio.
3. The market will open at 7am and close at 5pm (+10 GMT).
