Foodr, is an web application, allowing users to find food deals nearby. To shine light on the context of why we need this application, we are currently living in an age where people are constantly watching their budget as well as what they eat. This means that finding a restaurant which caters to their needs and wants is becoming increasingly difficult with all the options available. People are also highly attracted to the notion of obtaining discounted or free meals. We designed a web application to address these specific growing needs.

With our web application, users are able to search and filter results for restaurants with our innovative search criteria which covers all the important information you need regarding a restaurant. Users are also able to like and dislike restaurants and deals based on their preferences; liking saves the restaurant or deal for future usage, disliking removes the restaurant completely from future searches.. Our web application also tailors the search experience to each individual user, recommending new restaurants based on previously liked restaurants.

With all these niche features our web application offers, it is clear to see that the application has a use for everyone. Although, our primary market will be people aged 16-30 years old; people who live busy lifestyles, watch their budget constantly and often struggle deciding on what to eat. They thrive on new food concepts and are open to try new places to eat as well as being brought up in the digital age.
