This blog was written using jekyll, a ruby-based static site generator. It was written in a 20 hour sprint, but I'm constantly improving it. At first, I wrote it to publish math and computing notes to unsw students, but it's evolved to portfolio-like site. It's hosted on Github pages. Yay no server fees :)
