## My Role - Developer
I was a full-stack developer at BIRDI Pty Ltd. I helped develop the platform's api and front end. We used AWS for a lot of cloud tasks, which included transcoding video files, generating thumbnails etc. Most of the platform was written in Node and Angular. DynamoDB and MongoDB were the two core DB applications we utilised during the prototyping phase.
